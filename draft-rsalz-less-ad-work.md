--- abstract

This draft proposes a number of ways that the Area Director workload can
be reduced. It will be up to the IETF consensus process to set the final
list.

A major goal of this effort is to make it feasible for a wider diversity
of people to volunteer as a candidate for AD. Anecdotally, every IESG
complains about the AD workload, and says that it takes the first
full term to understand the job.
