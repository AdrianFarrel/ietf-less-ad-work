--- abstract

This draft proposes a number of ways that the Area Director workload can
be reduced. It will be up to the IETF consensus process to set the final
list.

A major goal of this effort is to make it feasible for a wider diversity
of people to volunteer as a candidate for AD. Anecdotally, every IESG
complains about the AD workload, and says that it takes the first
full term to understand the job.

# Introduction

Repeat the abstract.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Recommendations/Suggestions

## Only one AD to approve

A document should only require one AD in each area to approve.

## No "revisit" documents open across change-over

A new AD should not add be able to add work on authors, or for them.
If a previous AD did a poor job, it must be a public IESG decision that
the previous ballot should be ignored.

## Documents, not scheduling

What is the rationale for the IESG setting meeting logistics?

## Content not language

It is not an effectiv use of technical experts to review and correct
for things like typo's, etc.
We recognize that many ADs will, be "unable to help themselves."
We suggest that ADs can point out things that are not clear, and if
there are many of them, feel free to send the document back to the WG.
This will be hard, particularly for contributors were English is not
their native language.
Perhaps the IETF can offer resources to help with this before a document
gets to the RFC Production Center (which is more focused on copyediting,
anyway).

# Increasing the candidate pool

This document offers a number of suggestions to reduce the workload
of an IETF Area Director. Previous NomCom's have repeatedly heard that
the effort is involved is a full-time job. Few companies other than
large IT or Internet firms, can afford this.
This document offers some suggestions, in addition to reducing the workload,
that might help increase the diversity of candidates.

## Reimburse travel

Might help get more volunteers from other (less-wealthy? smaller companies?)
parts of the world.
We have learned to accomodate more remote meetings, perhaps that is enough.

## Pre-AD training

"So you want to be an AD" could be worthwhile training to offer.
Of course the IESG and the way the work vary, and it would have to
be done in consultation with them, but this might be interesting.
